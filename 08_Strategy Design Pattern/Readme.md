# Topics Covered in Strategy Design Pattern

## 1. What is the Strategy Design Pattern?

### Core Concept
- A behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime
- Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable
- Allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it

### Key Components
- Strategy Interface: Defines a common interface for all supported algorithms
- Concrete Strategies: Implement the algorithm defined by the strategy interface
- Context: Maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates the work

## 2. When and Why to Use Strategy Pattern

### Use Cases
- When you need to use different variants of an algorithm within an object
- When you have many similar classes that only differ in their behavior
- When you want to isolate the implementation details of an algorithm
- When you need to switch between different algorithms at runtime

### Benefits
- Eliminates conditional statements for selecting desired behavior
- Encapsulates what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Open/Closed Principle: New behaviors can be added without modifying existing code
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each strategy class handles one specific behavior

## 3. Implementation Using Clean OOP Principles

### Interface Segregation
- Separate interfaces for different behaviors (WalkableRobot, TalkableRobot, FlyableRobot)
- Each interface defines a single, focused behavior
- Clients only depend on the behaviors they need

### Composition Over Inheritance
- Robot class uses composition to include behaviors
- Behaviors are injected through constructor
- Flexible behavior modification without inheritance

### Encapsulation
- Behavior implementations are encapsulated in separate classes
- Internal implementation details are hidden from clients
- Easy to modify or extend behaviors without affecting clients

### Polymorphism
- Different robot types (CompanionRobot, WorkerRobot) can use same behaviors
- Behaviors can be swapped at runtime
- Common interface for all strategies

## 4. Practical Implementation: Robot Behavior System

### Strategy Interfaces
- WalkableRobot: Defines walking behavior
- TalkableRobot: Defines talking behavior
- FlyableRobot: Defines flying behavior

### Concrete Strategies
- NormalWalk/NoWalk: Different walking implementations
- NormalTalk/NoTalk: Different talking implementations
- NormalFly/NoFly: Different flying implementations

### Context (Robot Class)
- Abstract base class for different robot types
- Composes behaviors through strategy objects
- Delegates behavior execution to strategy objects

### Concrete Contexts
- CompanionRobot: Friendly robot with specific behaviors
- WorkerRobot: Industrial robot with different behaviors

## Remember Notes üìù

1. Use Strategy Pattern when you need to define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
2. Define behaviors through interfaces to ensure flexibility and extensibility
3. Use composition to include behaviors rather than inheritance
4. Keep strategies focused and single-purpose
5. Inject strategies through constructor for better dependency management
6. Make strategies independent of the context that uses them
7. Consider using Strategy Pattern to eliminate conditional statements
8. Remember that strategies can be changed at runtime
9. Each strategy should be independently testable
10. Follow the principle of least knowledge in class design
