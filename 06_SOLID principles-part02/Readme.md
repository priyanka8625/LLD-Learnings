# Day 6: SOLID Principles in Software Design (Part 2)

## Topics Covered
1. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) Guidelines
2. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
4. Code Examples and Implementation

## Detailed Notes

### 1. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) Guidelines
- Refinement of LSP concepts with specific guidelines
- Key Rules:
  - Method signatures must match
  - Preconditions cannot be strengthened
  - Postconditions cannot be weakened
  - Invariants must be preserved
  - History constraint must be maintained
- Implementation Best Practices:
  - Use proper inheritance hierarchies
  - Design by contract
  - Avoid type checking
  - Maintain behavioral compatibility

### 2. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use
- Key Concepts:
  - Split large interfaces into smaller, specific ones
  - Keep interfaces focused and cohesive
  - Avoid "fat" interfaces
  - Design interfaces based on client needs
- Benefits:
  - Better code organization
  - Reduced coupling
  - Easier maintenance
  - More flexible code
- Implementation Methods:
  - Interface segregation
  - Role interfaces
  - Client-specific interfaces

### 3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Both should depend on abstractions
- Key Concepts:
  - Depend on abstractions, not concretions
  - Use dependency injection
  - Invert the dependency direction
  - Program to interfaces
- Benefits:
  - Loose coupling
  - Better testability
  - More flexible code
  - Easier maintenance
- Implementation Methods:
  - Constructor injection
  - Setter injection
  - Interface injection
  - Service locator pattern

## Remember Note 📝
> Keep your interfaces as small as a single-purpose tool and your dependencies as flexible as a modular building block - that's the recipe for SOLID code!
