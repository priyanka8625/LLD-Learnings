# Topics Covered in Document Editor Application Design

## 1. Step-by-Step Approach to Real-World Design Problems

### Breaking Down the Problem
- Understanding document editor requirements (text, images, formatting)
- Identifying core functionalities (add content, render, save)
- Mapping user interactions (text input, image insertion, formatting)
- Defining system boundaries (editor, document, storage)

### Design Process
- Starting with high-level components (Document, Editor, Storage)
- Identifying relationships (composition, interfaces)
- Defining interfaces (DocumentElement, Persistence)
- Implementing concrete classes (TextElement, ImageElement, FileStorage)

## 2. Classes & Relationships

### Core Classes and Interfaces
- DocumentElement (Interface for all document elements)
  - TextElement (Concrete implementation for text)
  - ImageElement (Concrete implementation for images)
  - NewLineElement (Concrete implementation for line breaks)
  - TabSpaceElement (Concrete implementation for tab spaces)
- Document (Manages collection of document elements)
- DocumentEditor (Manages user interactions)
- Persistence (Interface for storage)
  - FileStorage (File-based implementation)
  - DBStorage (Database implementation)

### Key Relationships
- Interface Implementation (DocumentElement, Persistence)
- Composition (Document contains DocumentElements)
- Dependency Injection (DocumentEditor receives Document and Persistence)
- Inheritance (Concrete elements extend DocumentElement)

## 3. SOLID-Compliant Structure

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- DocumentElement: Each element type handles its own rendering
- Document: Manages only the collection of elements
- DocumentEditor: Handles only user interactions
- Storage implementations: Handle only persistence

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- New document elements can be added without modifying existing code
- New storage types can be added by implementing Persistence interface
- Document class is open for extension (new elements) but closed for modification

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All DocumentElement implementations are substitutable
- All Persistence implementations are substitutable
- Consistent behavior across all element types

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- DocumentElement interface is focused on rendering
- Persistence interface is focused on saving
- No client is forced to depend on methods it doesn't use

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions (DocumentElement, Persistence)
- DocumentEditor depends on Document and Persistence interfaces
- Concrete implementations can be swapped without affecting client code

## 4. Extensibility and Modularity

### Design for Extension
- New document elements can be added by implementing DocumentElement
- New storage types can be added by implementing Persistence
- Formatting features can be extended (NewLineElement, TabSpaceElement)
- Easy to add new document operations

### Modular Components
- Document elements are independent and self-contained
- Storage implementations are interchangeable
- Clear separation between document structure and operations
- Easy to test individual components

## Remember Notes üìù

1. Always start with interfaces to define contracts (DocumentElement, Persistence)
2. Use composition over inheritance for flexible relationships
3. Keep classes focused on a single responsibility
4. Design for extension by using interfaces and abstract classes
5. Use dependency injection for better testability and flexibility
6. Consider both current and future requirements
7. Make components loosely coupled and highly cohesive
8. Use polymorphism to handle different types of elements
9. Implement proper error handling (e.g., file operations)
10. Follow the principle of least knowledge in class design
