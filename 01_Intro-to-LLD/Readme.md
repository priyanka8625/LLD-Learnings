# Introduction to Low-Level Design (LLD)

## Key Topics

### 1. What is LLD?
- Design of individual components and their interactions
- Focuses on class-level design and implementation details
- Bridges gap between HLD and actual code
- Example: Designing a Parking Lot system's classes and their relationships

### 2. LLD vs DSA
- DSA: Focuses on problem-solving and algorithm efficiency
- LLD: Focuses on code organization, maintainability, and scalability
- DSA is about "how to solve", LLD is about "how to structure"
- Both are important: DSA for interviews, LLD for real-world development

### 3. DSA vs LLD vs HLD
- DSA: Algorithm design, time/space complexity
- LLD: Class design, SOLID principles, design patterns
- HLD: System architecture, scalability, databases
- They work together: HLD → LLD → DSA

## Quick Notes
- LLD is crucial for writing maintainable, scalable code
- Focus on class diagrams, relationships, and design patterns
- Practice by designing real-world systems (Parking Lot, Chess, etc.)
- Common in technical interviews for senior roles

*Remember: Good LLD makes code easy to understand, modify, and extend.*
