# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Part 1

## Key Topics

### 1. Programming Evolution
- Machine Code → Assembly → High-level Languages
- OOP emerged to handle complex software systems
- First OOP language: Simula (1967)
- Popular OOP languages: Java, C++, Python

### 2. Procedural vs OOP
- Procedural: Functions + Data (separate)
- OOP: Data + Functions (together as objects)
- Procedural: Hard to maintain, reuse, and extend
- OOP: Better organization, reusability, and maintenance

### 3. OOP Pillars Overview
- Abstraction: Hide complexity, show essential features
- Encapsulation: Bundle data and methods, control access
- Inheritance: (Next lecture)
- Polymorphism: (Next lecture)

### 4. Abstraction & Encapsulation Deep Dive
#### Abstraction
- Hide implementation details
- Show only necessary features
- Example: Car's steering wheel (use without knowing internals)
- Implementation: Abstract classes, interfaces

#### Encapsulation
- Bundle data and methods
- Control access using modifiers (public, private, protected)
- Example: Bank account (balance private, deposit/withdraw public)
- Implementation: Getters/setters, access modifiers

## Quick Notes
- OOP mirrors real-world objects
- Abstraction = What to show
- Encapsulation = How to hide
- Practice with real-world examples
- Common interview topics

*Remember: OOP helps write code that's easier to understand and maintain.*
