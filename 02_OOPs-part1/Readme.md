# 🎯 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Part 1

> "Object-oriented programming offers a sustainable way to write spaghetti code. It lets you accrete programs as a series of patches." - Paul Graham

## 🚀 The Evolution of Programming

```
Machine Code → Assembly → High-level Languages → OOP
    0101        MOV AX     print("Hello")    class Person
```

## 📚 Key Concepts

### 1. 🎭 Procedural vs OOP: The Showdown
| Procedural Programming | Object-Oriented Programming |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Functions + Data (separate) | Data + Functions (together) |
| Hard to maintain | Easy to maintain |
| Less reusable | Highly reusable |
| Like a recipe book | Like a restaurant menu |

### 2. 🏛️ The Four Pillars of OOP

#### 🎨 Abstraction
- **What it is**: Hiding complexity, showing only essential features
- **Real Example**: 🚗 Car's steering wheel
  - You know how to use it
  - You don't need to know how it works inside
- **Implementation**: Abstract classes, interfaces

#### 🎁 Encapsulation
- **What it is**: Bundling data and methods, controlling access
- **Real Example**: 🏦 Bank Account
  ```
  class BankAccount {
      private double balance;  // Hidden data
      public void deposit()    // Public methods
      public void withdraw()
  }
  ```
- **Implementation**: Access modifiers (public, private, protected)

## 💡 Quick Tips
- 🎯 OOP mirrors real-world objects
- 🎨 Abstraction = What to show
- 🎁 Encapsulation = How to hide
- 📝 Practice with real-world examples
- 💼 Common interview topics

## 🎓 Interview Preparation
When asked about OOP in interviews:
1. Start with the four pillars
2. Use real-world examples
3. Explain why OOP is better than procedural
4. Discuss when to use abstraction vs encapsulation

*💭 Remember: OOP is like organizing a kitchen - everything has its place, and you can easily find and use what you need!*
